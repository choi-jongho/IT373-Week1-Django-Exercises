My challenges during the assignments is how to start the environment, as it was kind of confusing and hard to do if not guided with a visual aid or an instructor. Additionally, the routing of the files and directories is also confusing as i have to open different files for them to run and sometimes it doesn't run, so it causes confusion where was I wrong. Lastly, the GitHub pushing and committing, the setup was also confusing as it was our first time using GitHub. I solved it by following the PowerPoint presentation and watching the recorded video of the class and also used AI for guidance if i didn't understand both PowerPoint and the video. Also watched some youtube tutorials and searched through the internet how to fix the errors and such.
